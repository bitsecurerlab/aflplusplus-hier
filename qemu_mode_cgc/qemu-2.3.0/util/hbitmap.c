/* HBitmaps provides an array of bits.  The bits are stored as usual in an
 * array of unsigned longs, but HBitmap is also optimized to provide fast
 * iteration over set bits; going from one bit to the next is O(logB n)
 * worst case, with B = sizeof(long) * CHAR_BIT: the result is low enough
 * that the number of levels is in fact fixed.
 *
 * In order to do this, it stacks multiple bitmaps with progressively coarser
 * granularity; in all levels except the last, bit N is set iff the N-th
 * unsigned long is nonzero in the immediately next level.  When iteration
 * completes on the last level it can examine the 2nd-last level to quickly
 * skip entire words, and even do so recursively to skip blocks of 64 words or
 * powers thereof (32 on 32-bit machines).
 *
 * Given an index in the bitmap, it can be split in group of bits like
 * this (for the 64-bit case):
 *
 *   bits 0-57 => word in the last bitmap     | bits 58-63 => bit in the word
 *   bits 0-51 => word in the 2nd-last bitmap | bits 52-57 => bit in the word
 *   bits 0-45 => word in the 3rd-last bitmap | bits 46-51 => bit in the word
 *
 * So it is easy to move up simply by shifting the index right by
 * log2(BITS_PER_LONG) bits.  To move down, you shift the index left
 * similarly, and add the word index within the group.  Iteration uses
 * ffs (find first set bit) to find the next word to examine; this
 * operation can be done in constant time in most current architectures.
 *
 * Setting or clearing a range of m bits on all levels, the work to perform
 * is O(m + m/W + m/W^2 + ...), which is O(m) like on a regular bitmap.
 *
 * When iterating on a bitmap, each bit (on any level) is only visited
 * once.  Hence, The total cost of visiting a bitmap with m bits in it is
 * the number of bits that are set in all bitmaps.  Unless the bitmap is
 * extremely sparse, this is also O(m + m/W + m/W^2 + ...), so the amortized
 * cost of advancing from one bit to the next is usually constant (worst case
 * O(logB n) as in the non-amortized complexity).

     * will actually represent a group of 2^G elements.  Each operation on a
     * range of bits first rounds the bits to determine which group they land
     * in, and then affect the entire page; iteration will only visit the first
     * bit of each group.  Here is an example of operations in a size-16,
     * granularity-1 HBitmap:
     *
     *    initial state            00000000
     *    set(start=0, count=9)    11111000 (iter: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
     *    reset(start=1, count=3)  00111000 (iter: 4, 6, 8)
     *    set(start=9, count=2)    00111100 (iter: 4, 6, 8, 10)
     *    reset(start=5, count=5)  00000000
     *
     * From an implementation point of view, when setting or resetting bits,
     * the bitmap will scale bit numbers right by this amount of bits.  When
     * iterating, the bitmap will scale bit numbers left by this amount of
