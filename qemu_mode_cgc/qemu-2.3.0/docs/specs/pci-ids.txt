PCI IDs for qemu
================

Red Hat, Inc. donates a part of its device ID range to qemu, to be used for
virtual devices.  The vendor IDs are 1af4 (formerly Qumranet ID) and 1b36.

Contact Gerd Hoffmann <kraxel@redhat.com> to get a device ID assigned
for your devices.

1af4 vendor ID
--------------

The 1000 -> 10ff device ID range is used as follows for virtio-pci devices.
Note that this allocation separate from the virtio device IDs, which are
maintained as part of the virtio specification.

1af4:1000  network device
1af4:1001  block device
1af4:1002  balloon device
1af4:1003  console device
1af4:1004  SCSI host bus adapter device
1af4:1005  entropy generator device
1af4:1009  9p filesystem device

1af4:10f0  Available for experimental usage without registration.  Must get
   to      official ID when the code leaves the test lab (i.e. when seeking
1af4:10ff  upstream merge or shipping a distro/product) to avoid conflicts.

1af4:1100  Used as PCI Subsystem ID for existing hardware devices emulated
           by qemu.

1af4:1110  ivshmem device (shared memory, docs/specs/ivshmem_device_spec.txt)

All other device IDs are reserved.

1b36 vendor ID
--------------

The 0000 -> 00ff device ID range is used as follows for QEMU-specific
PCI devices (other than virtio):

1b36:0001  PCI-PCI bridge
1b36:0002  PCI serial port (16550A) adapter (docs/specs/pci-serial.txt)
1b36:0003  PCI Dual-port 16550A adapter (docs/specs/pci-serial.txt)
1b36:0004  PCI Quad-port 16550A adapter (docs/specs/pci-serial.txt)
1b36:0005  PCI test device (docs/specs/pci-testdev.txt)
1b36:0007  PCI SD Card Host Controller Interface (SDHCI)

All these devices are documented in docs/specs.

The 0100 device ID is used for the QXL video card device.
